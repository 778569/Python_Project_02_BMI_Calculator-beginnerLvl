# Python_Project_02_BMI_Calculator
A program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.


The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))


important steps- 
Check the data type of the inputs.
Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
Remember PEMDAS.
Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
